**MilleFEuiIle** [ *mil·fœj* ] is a computational code built upon the open-source finite-element python library FEniCS, developed to solve thermo-mechanical evolution of
ice shells of icy bodies. Combining finite element method and Lagrangian markers, MilleFEuiIle can be used to address a variety of problems, such as

  + thermal/thermo-chemical convection
  + evolution of both surface and ice-ocean interface
  + phase transition between the ice shell and subsurface ocean
  + long-term tectonic extension/compression
  + tidally-driven partial melting

The code is provided with several demos and a thorough user guide, see [MilleFEuiIle documentation](https://kihoulou.github.io/MilleFEuiIle/).
