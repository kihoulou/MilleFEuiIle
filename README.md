The **MilleFEuiIle** [ _mil·fœj_ ] is a finite-element computational code based on the open-source FEniCS python package, developed to solve thermo-mechanical evolution of
ice shells of icy bodies. Combining finite element method and Lagrangian markers, MilleFEuiIle can be used to address a variety of problems, such as

+ thermal/thermo-chemical convection
+ evolution of both surface and ice-ocean interface
+ phase transition between the ice shell and subsurface ocean
+ long-term tectonic extension/compression
+ tidally-driven partial melting
