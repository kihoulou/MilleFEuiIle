=============================

Welcome to the *MilleFEuiIle*'s documentation!

The scope of *MilleFEuiIle*
----------------------------

*MilleFEuiIle* [mil·fœj], a short for **M**\ ulti-\ **I**\ nstrumenta\ **L** **L**\ agrangian-\ **E**\ ulerian **FE**\ niCS-\ **U**\ sing
**I**\ ce-\ **I** **L**\ ayer **E**\ xplorer, is a computational code built 
upon the open-source finite-element python library FEniCS, developed to solve thermo-mechanical 
evolution of ice shells of icy bodies. Combining finite element method and Lagrangian markers, 
*MilleFEuiIle* can be used to address a variety of problems in 2D Cartesian geometry, such as


* thermal and thermo-compositional convection
* evolution of surface and ice-ocean interface
* phase transition at the ice-ocean interface
* long-term tectonic deformation with visco-elasto-plastic rheology
* melt generation and transport inside the ice shell (using Rayleigh-Taylor approximation)
